# VRP_heuristic

File 1 
Created original heuristic for the VRP
Programed the heuristic
Created a random problem generator
Tested it with multiple cases
Drawn solutions

File2 
Created a Tabu Search algorithm for the QAP or the VRP(Harder)
Tested it with multiple examples
Small examples to compare with optimal solutions were presented
Large examples to test speed
Provided objective function vs iterations charts
Programmed it using the Jupyter Notebook for the QAP
